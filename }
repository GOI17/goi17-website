This gives you the best of both worlds: Docker’s ecosystem and Nix’s reproducibility.

## 6. When to Use Nix

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| You need reproducible builds across CI, staging, and production | Nix |
| You’re deploying to heterogeneous environments (ARM, x86, Windows, macOS) | Nix |
| You want fine‑grained control over every dependency | Nix |
| You’re comfortable with a functional language and want to avoid “Dockerfile hell” | Nix |
| You just need a quick container for a simple script | Docker |

## Bottom Line

Docker is great for quick, portable containers, but if you’re building complex, multi‑platform, or highly reproducible systems, Nix offers a powerful, declarative alternative. You can even combine them: use Nix to build your Docker images, ensuring that every image is deterministic and reproducible.
